    "bio":"Hey, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dharun Narayanan, a B.Tech Computer Science undergraduate student in AMRITA VISHWA VIDYAPEETHAM-COIMBATORE. I love exploring new technologies and often amazed by the progress we as a human species have made so far in recent years (apart from the in-box charger part!!). I have started reflecting my ideas and thougths through the medium of words recently so spelling and grammer mistakes are very often. You can write me back if you spot any.",
